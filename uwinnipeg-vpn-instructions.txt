To connect to nuclear or moment using WSL2:

1.  Start Cisco AnyConnect, connect to uwvpn.uwinnipeg.ca (the first
time) or UW Campus Access (the second time).  This will pop up another
window where you select UW Research Access and enter your username and
password.  You will also need to accept the login using Duo on your
mobile phone.

Sometimes the stupid Cisco app needs to reconnect a few times.  Just
be patient with the crappy software and hardware of Cisco.

2.  Follow the basic instructions here:
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4277

You need to create a new file called .wslconfig with the lines

[experimental]
networkingMode=mirrored
dnsTunneling=true

in the directory C:\Users\jmartin

3.  Start Ubuntu and everything should work.

You can add to the end of /etc/hosts the lines

# special hosts for uwinnipeg
142.132.30.201 nuclear
10.202.180.21 moment
10.202.180.22 electric
10.202.180.23 a10-3l11
10.202.180.24 dipole

You should be able to ssh to all of these machines, if the VPN is working.

2.  Once Cisco is happy, follow the basic instructions here:
https://gist.github.com/balmeida-nokia/122adf625c11c916902950e3255bd104

Using Windows Powershell in admin mode, do the following:

Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceDescription -Match "Cisco AnyConnect"} | Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceMetric 6000

Basically, that's all you need to do!


3.  Now you can connect to nuclear:
ssh 142.132.30.201
ssh nuclear.uwinnipeg.ca
or moment:
ssh 142.132.30.220
ssh moment.uwinnipeg.ca
