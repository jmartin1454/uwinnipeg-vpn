To connect to nuclear or moment using WSL2:

1.  Start Cisco AnyConnect, connect to uwvpn.uwinnipeg.ca (the first
time) or UW Campus Access (the second time).  This will pop up another
window where you select UW Research Access and enter your username and
password.  You will also need to accept the login using Duo on your
mobile phone.

Sometimes the stupid Cisco app needs to reconnect a few times.  Just
be patient with the crappy software and hardware of Cisco.


2.  Once Cisco is happy, follow the basic instructions here:

Using Windows Powershell in admin mode, do the following:

Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceDescription -Match "Cisco AnyConnect"} | Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceMetric 6000

Basically, that's all you need to do!


3.  Now you can connect to nuclear:
ssh 142.132.30.201
ssh nuclear.uwinnipeg.ca
or moment:
ssh 142.132.30.220
ssh moment.uwinnipeg.ca
